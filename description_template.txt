3   # The automaton has 3 states
1   # The initial state is the state 1
1   # There is 1 final state
3   # The final state is the state 3
6   # There are 6 transitions
1 a 2   # There is a transition from the state 1 to the state 2 when the character 'a' is read
1 b 1   # There is a transition from the state 1 to the state 1 when the character 'b' is read
2 a 3   # There is a transition from the state 2 to the state 3 when the character 'a' is read
2 b 1   # There is a transition from the state 2 to the state 1 when the character 'b' is read
3 a 3   # There is a transition from the state 3 to the state 3 when the character 'a' is read
3 b 1   # There is a transition from the state 3 to the state 1 when the character 'b' is read
